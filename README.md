This work was translated to French by **Danilo Renzi** and other collaborators from 2003 to 2004. Since the *Yahoo! Groups* service no longer exists and since I have lost my old email accounts, I'm no longer able to identify the remaining collaborators. If you've worked on this project, you can claim your contribution to ionecum__at__gmail.com. You must also show an evidence that prove you have contributed. 

This translation was granted by **Randall Hyde** himself on 2003. The original text in English and the resources can be found here

The sources and programs accompanying the book can be found inside the *ArtOfAsmSources_and_programs* folder (zipped). But notice that most of these programs won't run on modern Windows systems. If you want to run them, you should use a DOS emulator, such as DosBOX or any other emulator supporting early versions of Windows. Properly running these programs is outside the aim of this project (which is no more than a translation project). The files were not tested on any emulator and there is no guarantee at all they will run.
